Hi Luke,

I have taken a few design liberties in hopes of bringing the current website content more in line with accessibility needs, mostly just in making the text larger and the margins smaller. This can all be adjusted as you need and fonts, font sizes and colors, and section colors can all be adjusted as well. The site is responsive to a certain degree, but looks a little odd on a mobile phone or a 4k monitor. I plan to learn more about how to have content sense when the site is being displayed on an extremely large or small monitor and resize/reformat itself accordingly.

The buttons can also be reformatted, I avoided the Trustpilot logo in one button and used the color of the logo as the border instead, the buttons can be whatever color/shape you like and once I have access to the Trustpilot logo I can plug that in as well.

I can also plug in whatever information you like for the review carousel, I used some open-source pictures and lorem-ipsum instead of actual reviews as I thought that was a little close to copyright stuff.

Let me know what you think!
